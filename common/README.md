## atomic design

1) atoms : Atoms are the basic building blocks.
   examples : labels, buttons, text field, etc.

2) molecules : Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest units.
   examples : search field with search button.

3) organisms : Organisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex of an interface.
   examples : app bar with back button  text heading label and notification icon.

4) pages : Actual Ui pages, consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages.
   examples : splash screen, login screen, dashboard screen.
